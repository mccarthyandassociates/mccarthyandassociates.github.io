            <h1>About Us</h1>

            <p>Bill McCarthy is the President and founder of Bill McCarthy & Associates.</p>

            <p>Mr. McCarthy has a degree in Finance from Boston University's School of Management. Almost immediately out of college he started the first proprietary Meals-On-Wheels in the country in and around the greater Boston area, serving over 50 communities.</p>

            <p>He moved from Boston to Cleveland in 1978 where he continued to work with seniors. In 1990 he earned his insurance license and 1994 his security license. Today he operates a full insurance agency and can conduct all functions of a stockbroker. In 1999 he started his own Registered Investment Advisor firm. Since then he has become licensed as a Certified Estate Planner.</p>

            <p>Today, his practice has evolved to a highly specialized area dealing with the long term care issues of older adults, particularly those in assisted living facilities and nursing homes.</p>

            <p>From his Hudson, Ohio office he helps people all over Ohio and Florida.</p>
